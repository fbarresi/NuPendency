# NuPendency
NuPendency is a small tool that letÂ´s you explore your nuGet-dependency structure. Simply tell NuPendency the package name and it will show you the depending packages...

NuPendency will show you the dependencies as "force-directed-graph".

## Planed features:
- Load packages from Visual Studio-Solution/Projects
- "Explore from here" (e.g. right-click on node and use it as root-node for a new dependency graph)
